KEY FINDINGS
============

CRITICAL ISSUES (Week 1):
  - Ineffective health checks (only check if Python exists)
  - Secrets exposed via environment variables
  - No image digest pinning
  - No startup validation

IMPORTANT ISSUES (Week 2):
  - No graceful shutdown mechanism
  - Missing logging configuration
  - No startup validation for requirements

IMPROVEMENTS (Week 3+):
  - Non-optimal build caching
  - No centralized metrics
  - Resource limits may need adjustment

RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY
=======================

PHASE 1 (Week 1): Critical Security - 5-6 hours
  - Pin image digests
  - Implement health checks
  - Add startup validation
  - Add credential filtering

PHASE 2 (Week 2): Production Readiness - 4-6 hours
  - Add graceful shutdown
  - Configure logging driver
  - Database initialization

PHASE 3 (Week 3+): Optimization - 4-7 hours
  - BuildKit optimization
  - Memory monitoring
  - Metrics endpoints

PHASE 4 (Optional): Advanced Security - 3-5 hours
  - Secrets management
  - Security scanning setup

TOTAL ESTIMATED EFFORT: 20-30 hours over 3-4 weeks

  - Expected delivery time: 5-6 hours
  - Risk level: Low
  - Impact: High

Week 2 (Days 1-2): Phase 2 Production Readiness
